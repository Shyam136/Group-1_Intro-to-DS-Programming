## Abstract 

This project **(needs a name)** is a python-based app that determines, using release-time features, which between two user selected movies will have the higher inflation-adjusted domestic gross revenue. Understanding how release-time features influence gross revenue is important for movie stakeholders, like studios, producers, and even audiences, to understand what makes a 'good' movie.  This will improve the movie-making and movie-going experience over time by allowing for resources to be put towards proven features that make films commercially successful, including genre, age rating, runtime, and more. 
This app uses Kaggle's *Movie Industry* dataset by Daniel Grijalva. This dataset covers over 7,500 movies released commercially in the United States through the years 1980 to 2020 (inclusive).
