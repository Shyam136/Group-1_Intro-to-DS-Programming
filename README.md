# Which Movie Will Gross More? ðŸŽ¬  

## Abstract / Overview  
This project is a Python-based Streamlit app that predicts, using **release-time metadata**, which of two user-selected movies will have the higher **inflation-adjusted domestic gross revenue**.  

Studios and producers often need to estimate box office potential before committing to budgets and marketing. Our tool provides a data-driven way to compare movies, reducing financial risk and helping allocate resources more effectively.  

The app uses Kaggleâ€™s *Movie Industry Dataset* by Daniel Grijalvas, covering ~7,600 movies released between 1980â€“2020. Features include genre, rating, budget, gross revenue, runtime, and release year.

## Stakeholder Use Case
![Stakeholder Use Case - Movie Comparer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e897d94-2012-4ef1-a104-4e6bb582cd5a) 
- **Studios/Producers** â†’ Compare two movies at the concept stage to guide budget and marketing.  
- **Distributors/Marketers** â†’ Identify trends in what types of films perform better.  
- **Audiences/Researchers** â†’ Explore patterns in movie success across genres, decades, and budgets.

## Data Description (Stub â€“ to be expanded by Neville)  
- **Source**: [Movie Industry Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies) (Daniel Grijalvas, Kaggle).  
- **Rows**: ~7,600 movies (1980â€“2020).  
- **Features**:  
  - *Continuous*: Budget, Gross (inflation-adjusted), Runtime.  
  - *Categorical*: Genre, Rating, Year.  
- **Cleaning Steps**: Inflation adjustment, handling missing values, feature encoding (to be documented).

## Contributing Guidelines  
To keep the repo clean and consistent:  
1. **Pull from `main`** before starting work on your branch.  
2. Work in **your personal branch** (e.g., `shyam-dev`, `noor-ui`).  
3. Commit often with clear messages (e.g., `feat: add preprocessing for inflation`).  
4. **Push** your branch regularly.  
5. Open a **Pull Request** into `main` once your code is working.  
6. During standups, weâ€™ll cross off tasks and update roadblocks together.

## Ethical Concerns (to expand later)  
- Dataset bias: focuses only on U.S. domestic box office.  
- Does not account for streaming, global markets, or post-release reception.  
- Predictions should not be seen as guarantees but as exploratory guidance.
